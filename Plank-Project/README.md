# \# Plank Form Evaluation (MediaPipe)

# 

# This project evaluates plank exercise form using MediaPipe Pose.

# 

# \## Key Features

# \- Real-time pose estimation

# \- Body alignment angle calculation

# \- Correct / Incorrect plank detection

# \- Hold time measurement

# 

# \## How it works

# The angle between shoulder, hip, and ankle is computed.

# If the angle stays within \[165°, 180°], the plank is considered correct.

# 

# \## Run
